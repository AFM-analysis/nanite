3.0.0
 - BREAKING CHANGE: The contact point estimation method "scheme_2020"
   has been removed, although it has been the default for some time.
   It turns out that it does not perform so well and there are other
   more stable methods (to be implemented). Furthermore, some of the
   contact point estimation methods were improved so that basically
   many tests had to be updated. This will not break your analysis,
   it just means your contact points will change.

   accepts the "method" argument (see new poc submodule)
