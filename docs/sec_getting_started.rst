Installation
============

To install nanite, use one of the following methods
(the above package dependencies will be installed automatically):
    
* from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nanite>`_:
    ``pip install nanite``
* from `sources <https://github.com/AFM-Analysus/nanite>`_:
    ``pip install .`` or 
    ``python setup.py install``

Note that if you are installing from source or if no binary wheel is
available for your platform and Python version, `Cython <http://cython.org/>`_
will be installed to build the required nanite extensions. If this process
fails, please request a binary wheel for your platform (e.g. Windows 64bit)
and Python version (e.g. 3.6) by creating a new
`issue <https://github.com/AFM-Abalysis/nanite/issues>`_.
